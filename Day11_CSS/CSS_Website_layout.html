		<p>Blogs are a type of websites that contain mainly web pages authored in HTML (although the blogger may be completely unaware 
		that the web pages are composed using HTML due to the blogging tool that may be in use). Millions of people use blogs online;
		a blog is now the new "home page", that is, a place where a persona can reveal personal information, and/or build a concept 
		as to who this persona is. Even though a blog may be written for other purposes, such as promoting a business, the core of a
		blog is the fact that it is written by a "person" and that person reveals information from her/his perspective. Blogs have become
		a mighty weapon used by content marketers who desire to increase their site's traffic, as well as, rank in the search engine 
		result pages (SERPs).
		Modern research from Technorati shows that blogs now outrank social networks for consumer influence</p>
