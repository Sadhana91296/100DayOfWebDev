<p>Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.<br>
 Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container.<br>
 The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins:<br></p>
 
 <div id="t1">This division have 800px width</div><br>
 
 <div id="t2">This division have max-width 800px</div><br><br>
